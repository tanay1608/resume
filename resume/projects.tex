          \item {\textbf{Objective: }Reproduction of high order Ambisonic recordings over irregular loudspeaker arrays.}
          \item {Performed the array decomposition for irregular loudspeaker arrangement by distributing it into symmetric, regular and irregular arrangement and carrying out the convolutions separately using MATLAB.}
          \item {Made silicone ears for making the Head Related Transfer Function (HRTF) database similar to CIPIC database. Used Artec Software for 3D scanning of the ear and made a mold of it using that STL file on Autodesk Fusion 360.}
